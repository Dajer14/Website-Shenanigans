  Begin your Quest Below!
</h1></center>
<h4>
<p>The first scenario is set in medieval times. You are an explorer and want to find some new loot inside a dungeon. This will be one of the most dangerous dungeons you have explored, but the loot you will earn surpasses this danger! Be careful, because at every turn there are disguisting enemies and unique traps. </p>
<p>The next scenario is set in a time where there are no swords or intricate armors. Everything is primitive because you are a tribal leader. You are put up against the challenge of leading this ancient tribe, and some problems may include rebels, thieves, etc...</p>
