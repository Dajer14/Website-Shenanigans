Web Page Development, 2nd Period, Fall 2016

I've created a master index.html page where all students will link their personal sites.

Create a four page website with the following minimum elements:

Crop and resize various images

Consistent look and feel throughout the website

The same page heading, navigation bar, and footer on each page

Hot spot(s)

Table(s)

Roll-over buttons and/or drop-down menus

Background image(s)

Hyper-link(s)

Import graphics (jpeg/gif)

Page titles

Font changes (color, size, style)

External CSS
